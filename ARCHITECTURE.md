# Gamification System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the gamification system, explaining key components, data flows, and design decisions made during implementation.

## System Components

The gamification system consists of the following key components:

1. **Backend API (Node.js, Koa, TypeScript)**

   - RESTful API endpoints for user management, element creation, answer submission, and leaderboard retrieval
   - SOLID principles applied through separation of concerns and dependency inversion

2. **Database Layer (MySQL)**

   - Persistent storage for all gamification data
   - Normalized schema design for data integrity and efficient querying

3. **Caching Layer (Redis)**

   - Performance optimization through caching of frequently-accessed data
   - Reduced database load for read-heavy operations

4. **Asynchronous Processing (Job Queue)**

   - Decoupled score calculation from the main request flow
   - Improved system responsiveness and scalability

5. **Frontend Component (React)**
   - Simple user interface for leaderboard display
   - User authentication through username-based login
